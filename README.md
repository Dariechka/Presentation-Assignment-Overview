# Presentation about The Story of Linux Kernel &amp; Linus Torvalds

✅
In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, few entities have left an indelible mark quite like Linux.
The idea of new at that time operating system was born out of Linus Torvalds and has become a cornerstone of the digital world.
Letter Torvalds began development on Git, which also became widely used.

## The story of Linux begins in the early 1990s

Linus was student of computer science at the University of Helsinki.
He begins on a quest to create a Unix-like operating system kernel on monolithic architecture, with the entire operating system running in kernel space.
Unlike microkernel architecture, which effectively splits up the kernel into smaller, distinct programs that work together to give the desired functionality.
Torvalds was motivated by the desire to have a system that could run on his personal computer while adhering to the principles of open source collaboration.

✅
Of course, he read a book 'Operating systems' by Dutch Professor Andrew Tanenbaum, who really want to teach his students his approach what a real operating system was all about.
Tanenbaum also published his code and everybody really looked at that. His operating system was something called Minix operating system.
On August 25th 1991 Linus posted to the Minix users group an email, where he wrote:

✅
“Hello everybody out there using minix –
I’m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won’t be big and professional like gnu). This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready.
I’ve currently ported bash and gcc, and things seem to work. This implies that I’ll get something practical within a few months, and I’d like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won’t promise I’ll implement them ????
P.S. Yes – it’s free of any minix code.

✅
After this letter he got a lot of comments about his new system.
Professor Tanenbaum responded who was a real a hero. Tanenbaum still maintains the point that design a monolithic kernel is a fundamental error and Linus must be thankful him and won't be more his student.
Tanenbaum thought, that he would not get a high grade of such design.
It was famous Tanenbaum–Torvalds debate. Tanenbaum argued that microkernels are superior to monolithic kernels and therefore Linux was, even in 1991, obsolete.
(At this slide you can see main differences between these two approaches)

## Open Source Revolution

This position of Tanenbaum relly hurt Linus, but he didn't stop.
Unlike proprietary operating systems that were closely guarded, Torvalds adopted an open-source approach. It is a principle of transparency, collaboration, and shared development.
Its source code is freely available to the public, encouraging a global community of developers to contribute and modify their own versions of the operating system.
The roots of the open-source movement can be traced back to the Free Software Foundation and the GNU Project led by Richard Stallman.
The GNU General Public License (GPL), introduced by Stallman, played a pivotal role in formalizing the concept of free software, ensuring that users had the freedom to run, share, and modify software.

✅

## Evolution of the Linux Kernel

The Linux kernel has undergone a remarkable evolution. Torvalds adopted a decentralized development model, allowing contributors from around the world to submit improvements.
The kernel’s architecture became supporting a wide range of hardware platforms. As a result, Linux has become the go-to choice for various devices, from servers to embedded systems and mobile devices.

Approach of Linus Torvalds allowed developers to add code that extend the kernel’s functionality without modifying the core code.
This modular design made Linux adaptable to a wide range of hardware architectures.

✅

## The Rise of Distributions

One of the factors contributing to Linux’s widespread adoption is the development of distributions, or “distros”.
These are complete operating systems built around the Linux kernel, packaged with utilities, libraries, and software applications.
Notable distros like Debian, Red Hat, Ubuntu, and Fedora have emerged, each catering to specific user needs and technical requirements.
The diversity of distros has played a crucial role in making Linux accessible to a broad audience.

✅

## Linux in the Enterprise

Stability and cost-effectiveness of Linux have made it a preferred choice for enterprise environments.
Major corporations, including IBM, Google, and Amazon, have embraced Linux for server infrastructure, cloud computing, and mission-critical applications.
The scalability and performance of Linux have positioned it as a reliable foundation for the digital infrastructure that powers the modern business landscape.

✅

## Linux on the Desktop

Desktop environments like GNOME and KDE, coupled with user-friendly distros such as Ubuntu and Mint, have made Linux more accessible to everyday users.
The main advantage of such system is the availability of a vast repository of software through package managers.
But on the other hand the user interface and experience were often considered less polished compared to alternatives like Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS.

✅

## Challenges and Controversies

Despite its successes, Linux has faced its fair share of challenges and controversies.
The debate over the adoption of a standard Linux desktop, occasional clashes within the development community, and legal battles over the use of the Linux trademark.
With numerous distributions, desktop environments, and package management systems, some critics argue that this diversity can hinder standardization and create compatibility challenges.
On the other hand, proponents emphasize the freedom of choice and customization options that this diversity provides.

✅

## Linux and the Future

As we gaze into the future, Linux continues to play a pivotal role in shaping the technological landscape.
The rise of containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, coupled with the increasing prevalence of edge computing, highlights Linux’s adaptability and relevance.
The future of Linux is characterized by its continued evolution and adaptation to emerging trend

✅

## Conclusion

Though the idea and philosophy of Unix was crafted in a small corner of Bell Labs by a tiny group of people, our world today would simply not run without those groundbreaking technologies built on top of it along the way.
The Linux kernel has grown to become the largest single open-source project on the planet with hundreds of companies involved, thousands of contributors from every corner of the globe, millions of lines of code, and billions of users driving the future of technology every single day.
Quite simply, the world runs on Unix, and it doesn’t appear to be slowing down any time soon.
